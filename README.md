# recharts-toolkit
Recharts-toolkit is a wrapper library that provides out of the box interactive graphing components and more. While Recharts aims to keep its "API surface small and straightforward",
it's quite limited and requires tedious workarounds for more complex requirements. The purpose of this library is to make recharts more extensible and provide tools
to make your graphs interactive whilst remaining a 'thin' layer on top of recharts and compatible with existing graph definitions (including future versions).
